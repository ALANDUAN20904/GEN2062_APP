This repo is to store course content and codes from HanYang Winter School 2024/25 ITC3010 Mobile App Programming class, taught by Prof.Tak Moonho. 
I have also created a simple UI page for GEN2062X mid-service blueprint, which uses XML and Java to create simple animations of a drawable image. 

Check out the project page [here]([url](https://github.com/Alanduan21/GEN2062_APP/blob/main/Duan_Yihe_GEN2062X_Mid_Service_Blueprint_Annex.pdf))!
